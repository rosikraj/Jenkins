in playwright we can create test in two different ways :
1) 1st approach is by using codegen plugin/test generator 
2)write our own script and how can run the test

--------

How to start writing our test?
ans:we use test block 
->test ()
-- in these we need to write Anonymous function and two parameters . 
1)we need to pass first parameter is 'Title'of the test , we can provide any name of the test
->test('HomepageTest')
2)we need to pass Anonymous function ()=>{}, in the sense Open Bracket and Arrow function 

-> test ('HomepageTest',()=>{
})

------------
{page} --picture we have to pass inside the anonymous function
->it contains so many functions and through them we can automate web application 
->"we can access all the methods,to check element and get text from the page and launch web page" all these commands avaible in page (its is a picture in playwright)

test ('HomepageTest',({page})=>{
})

--------------
-We need to add these keywords:
(async and await)

-before the function start async should add
-whenever we are accessing methods from the page picture , we have to add specify await

test('Home page',async ({page})=>{

await page.goto('https://www.google.com');

-----------------------------
javascript is async(parallelly all the steps execute but in automated test we want "step by step appraoch"to make that we have to handle promise.
By using these it will be handled:

->"async"-async keyword will make the function written a promise

->"await"-await keyword makes the function wait fot the promise
